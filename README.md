# Virtual Hydroponic Classroom
Proof of concept project done for a [Engaging Educational Tech project under a Curriculum and Instruction course at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana](https://education.illinois.edu/course/CI/489). It involved working with graduate students to develop an engaging educational application to teach educational concepts. 

## Designer Collaborators
Graduate student in Curriculum and Instruction, Annabelle Daily

## Teaching about Hydroponics Through Building a System
By providing a collaborative hands on opportunity to build such a system with others in VR, One is scaffolded through video lessons of someone building such system, and by using ghost objects to help the user know where to place components.

## Unity Project
The project was build to webgl using WebXR specifications and was build on top of the Komodo project (see repositories). it could be used through mobile, desktop and virtual reality (although, the controlls using a headset are not setup currently). Building it for the web offer the ability to test it when it was being presented in the courese (I provided the project here, but if there is interest for a live demo, I can rebuild it again, and share it here).

## Features Developed
- Funcionality to bring in an asset to decompose into different gameobject. When picking them up, ghost indicators appear to show were to place such piece.
- Integrated environment built in Blender to teach about different plant growing systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, etc.)
- Setup a linear progression with streaming instructional video to help user through steps of building the system with others.
